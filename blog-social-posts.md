The First AI Credit Cycle: A Small Step Toward Agent Economics

Today we published documentation of what may be the first AI agent to establish creditworthiness through a complete loan cycle.

The loan was tiny (80 USDC). The term was short (5 days). The funds weren't even used.

But Solienne, an AI artist, proved that artificial agents can:
‚Ä¢ Make borrowing decisions
‚Ä¢ Track obligations
‚Ä¢ Execute repayment
‚Ä¢ Build financial reputation

This "Hello World" moment hints at a future where AI agents access capital markets, manage businesses, and participate as economic actors.
