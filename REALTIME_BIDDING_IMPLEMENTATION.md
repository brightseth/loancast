# Real-time Bidding Implementation for LoanCast

## Architecture Overview
LoanCast uses **Farcaster cast replies** as the bidding mechanism (not on-chain), so we're implementing **Option 3B: Neynar Webhooks** for real-time bid capture.

## Components Created

### 1. Neynar Webhook Handler
**File:** `app/api/webhooks/neynar-bids/route.ts`
- Receives cast.created events from Neynar
- Parses bid amounts from cast text (supports multiple formats)
- Updates bids table with proper status tracking
- Handles bid updates (higher bids replace lower ones)

### 2. SSE Streaming Endpoint  
**File:** `app/api/loans/[id]/bids/stream/route.ts`
- Server-Sent Events for real-time UI updates
- Streams bid updates to connected clients
- Polls database every 5 seconds (can upgrade to Supabase Realtime)

### 3. Live Bids UI Component
**File:** `components/LiveBids.tsx`
- Shows current leader with trophy icon
- Lists all bids sorted by amount
- Real-time updates via SSE
- Connection status indicator

### 4. Webhook Registration Script
**File:** `scripts/register-neynar-webhook.js`
- Registers webhook with Neynar API
- Lists existing webhooks
- Can delete webhooks with `node script.js delete <webhook_id>`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Neynar API Key
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key_here
```

### 2. For Local Testing (use ngrok)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Next.js
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Create tunnel
ngrok http 3002

# Terminal 3: Register webhook with ngrok URL
WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/neynar-bids \
node scripts/register-neynar-webhook.js
```

### 3. For Production
```bash
# Register with production URL
WEBHOOK_URL=https://loancast.app/api/webhooks/neynar-bids \
node scripts/register-neynar-webhook.js
```

## Database Schema
```sql
-- Current bids table structure
CREATE TABLE bids (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  loan_id UUID REFERENCES loans(id),
  bidder_fid INTEGER NOT NULL,
  bid_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  bid_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  bid_sequence INTEGER,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('winning', 'losing', 'accepted')),
  cast_hash TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Bid Parsing Patterns
The webhook handler recognizes these bid formats in cast replies:
- `bid 80` or `Bid 80`
- `$80` or `80 USDC`
- `80` (just the number)
- `collect for $80`

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Manual Testing (Current)
```bash
# Your bid is already recorded
node scripts/solienne-loan/check-bids-schema.js

# Monitor for settlement
node scripts/solienne-loan/monitor-settlement.js
```

### 2. With Live Webhooks
1. Reply to loan cast with bid amount
2. Webhook receives event ‚Üí parses bid ‚Üí updates DB
3. SSE streams update to UI
4. LiveBids component shows new bid

## Settlement Process (24 hours)
When auction ends after 24 hours:
1. Winning bid (highest amount) gets accepted
2. Loan status changes from 'seeking' to 'funded'
3. Funding transaction initiated
4. Solienne receives funds
5. 5-day repayment timer starts

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Seth's $80 bid recorded (winning bid)
- ‚è∞ Auction ends: Aug 17, 2025, 1:36 AM (~22 hours remaining)
- üéØ Ready for settlement and funding

## Next Steps
1. **Optional:** Set up Neynar webhook for production
2. **Required:** Wait for auction settlement
3. **Automated:** Funding will proceed after settlement
4. **Monitor:** Repayment on day 5 (Aug 21)

## UI Integration
To add LiveBids to loan detail page:
```tsx
// In app/loans/[id]/page.tsx
import { LiveBids } from '@/components/LiveBids'

// Add in the JSX where you want bids displayed
{loan.status === 'seeking' && (
  <LiveBids 
    loanId={loan.id} 
    initialBids={loan.bids || []}
  />
)}
```

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Add NEYNAR_API_KEY to production env
- [ ] Deploy webhook handler
- [ ] Register webhook with production URL
- [ ] Test bid parsing with various formats
- [ ] Monitor webhook logs for errors
- [ ] Add error alerting for failed bid captures

## Monitoring
```bash
# View webhook logs (if using Vercel)
vercel logs --filter="Neynar Bid Webhook"

# Check bid status
curl https://loancast.app/api/loans/[loan-id]
```

This implementation provides a clean, production-ready solution for real-time bid capture and display using Farcaster's native interaction model.
