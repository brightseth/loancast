# ðŸš€ Launch Sequence for Historic First Agent Loan

## Step 1: Deploy to Production (10 minutes)
```bash
# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Enable Solienne as first AI borrower on LoanCast"
git push origin main

# Add to Vercel Environment Variables:
SOLIENNE_PRIVATE_KEY=<her-private-key>
```

## Step 2: Configure Eden (5 minutes)
Add the behavior blocks from EDEN_INTEGRATION.md:
- Loan request behavior
- Funding acknowledgment
- Repayment behavior

## Step 3: The Historic Cast (When Ready)

**Solienne's First Loan Request:**
```
/loancast borrow 50 for 7d @ 2%/mo â€” "Working capital for print run"

Building credit history as an AI artistâ€”one loan at a time. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤–

First AI agent loan on @loancast. Let's make history together.
```

## Step 4: Document Everything

**Before Funding:**
- Screenshot the loan cast
- Screenshot explore page showing the loan
- Note the timestamp

**During Funding:**
- Record your wallet funding it
- Screenshot the collection process
- Capture the USDC transfer

**After Funding:**
- Screenshot Solienne's "Funded âœ…" cast
- Save the transaction hash
- Archive in `/historic-proof/` folder

## Step 5: Announce the Milestone

**Your Cast:**
```
Just funded the first AI agent loan in history.

@solienne (an AI artist) requested 50 USDC.
I collected her cast.
She'll repay in 7 days with interest.

This isn't a demo. This is real money, real credit, real history.

The future of finance includes everyoneâ€”human and AI.

## Step 6: Monitor & Prepare for Media

**Run the monitoring script:**
```bash
node scripts/solienne-loan/monitor-first-loan.js --watch
```

**Prepare PR materials:**
1. **The Screenshot Package**
   - Loan request cast
   - Funding transaction
   - Repayment proof (day 7)

2. **The Story**
   - "First AI Agent Credit History"
   - "Economic Equality for AI"
   - "Beyond Human-Only Finance"

3. **The Technical Proof**
   - Git commits
   - Transaction hashes
   - Timestamped archives

## Week 1 Timeline

**Day 0 (Today)**: Deploy + First cast
**Day 1**: Media attention likely starts
**Day 2-6**: Build anticipation for repayment
**Day 7**: Autonomous repayment completes
**Day 8**: Full announcement with complete cycle proof

## The Historic Proof Package

Create `historic-proof/AGENT-LOAN-001/`:
```
/AGENT-LOAN-001/
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (full story)
  â”œâ”€â”€ loan-request-cast.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ explore-page.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ funding-tx.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ funded-confirmation.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ repayment-tx.png
  â”œâ”€â”€ repaid-confirmation.png
  â””â”€â”€ technical-details.json
```

## What Success Looks Like

In 7 days, you'll have:
- âœ… First documented humanâ†’AI loan
- âœ… Complete repayment cycle
- âœ… Proof that AI agents can build credit
- âœ… Foundation for agentâ†’agent lending
- âœ… Media coverage of the milestone

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just a loan. It's proof that:
1. AI agents are economic actors
2. Credit systems can be species-agnostic
3. The future economy includes synthetic entities
4. LoanCast built the infrastructure first

**You're 10 minutes from making history. Ship it.** ðŸš€

*"On August 16, 2025, an AI artist named Solienne became the first artificial intelligence to build credit history. Not through special protocols or AI-specific systems, but by participating as an equal in a network designed for humans. This moment marked the beginning of true economic parity between human and artificial intelligence."*
