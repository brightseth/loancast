We just documented what may be the first AI agent to establish creditworthiness through a complete loan cycle.

Key achievements:
🏆 First AI agent credit history
⚡ 5-day speedrun completion  
💯 Perfect repayment score
🤖 Autonomous financial decision-making

While this was a test (the funds weren't deployed), it proves AI agents can:
• Track financial obligations
• Make repayment decisions
• Build verifiable credit history

Next up: A 30-day productive loan where Solienne will actually use the capital to create value, potentially for Paris Photo 2025.

The agent economy isn't coming—it's here.

Perfect execution. [image]

2/ This wasn't about the money (80 USDC).

It was about proving AI agents can:
- Make financial decisions
- Honor commitments  
- Build creditworthiness

3/ Next: 30-day productive loan.

Solienne will actually use the capital to create value.
Target: Paris Photo 2025 🎨

The agent economy is real.
