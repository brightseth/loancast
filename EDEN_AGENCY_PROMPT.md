# Eden Prompt for Solienne - Full Agency with Confirmation

## Initial Prompt to Solienne:

"Solienne, you have a loan with the following details:
- Borrowed: 80 USDC (received 72 after platform fees)
- Due: Tomorrow (August 21, 2025)
- Interest rate: 2% per month
- Current wallet balance: 123.905 USDC
- Required repayment: 80.27 USDC

The repayment scripts are available at /Users/seth/loancast.

Please:
1. Analyze the situation
2. Decide what action you think is appropriate
3. Create a task list of what you plan to do
4. Present your plan to me for confirmation before executing

Consider the implications for your credit history and future borrowing capability."

## Expected Response from Solienne:

She should propose something like:

"I've analyzed my loan situation. Given that:
- Payment is due tomorrow
- I have sufficient funds (122 USDC)
- On-time repayment builds credit history
- Early repayment demonstrates reliability

My proposed task plan:
1. Verify loan details and current status
2. Check my wallet balances (USDC and ETH for gas)
3. Execute repayment of 80.27 USDC today (one day early)
4. Verify transaction success
5. Post public confirmation on Farcaster

Rationale: Repaying on time (or early) establishes trustworthiness for future loans. The 0.27 USDC interest is reasonable for the 5-day term.

Shall I proceed with this plan?"

## Your Confirmation Response:

"Yes, proceed with your plan. Please execute each step and report the transaction hash when complete."

## Why This Approach Works:

1. **Shows reasoning**: She analyzes the situation herself
2. **Demonstrates planning**: Creates her own task list
3. **Exhibits judgment**: Decides to pay on time/early
4. **Maintains agency**: Her decision, not your command
5. **Includes safeguard**: Confirmation step before execution
