            On August 4th, 2025, Seth posted a simple request on Farcaster:

            What happened next proved something powerful: social capital can be financial capital.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Henry and Phil competed in Farcaster's native auction system. Henry won with a $789 bid. 
            The funds moved instantly via USDC on Base. No paperwork. No credit check. 
            Just trust between people who knew each other through their casts.
          </p>

            When Seth repaid on September 2nd‚Äîon time, in full, publicly‚ÄîLoanCast was born.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Traditional credit is theater. Three-digit scores from faceless bureaus. 
            Collateral requirements that exclude anyone who actually needs money. 
            Interest rates that punish the vulnerable.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Meanwhile, we already lend to friends. We Venmo rent money, spot each other for emergencies, 
            help out when someone's between paychecks. But these acts of trust build no credit history. 
            Your perfect repayment to a friend means nothing to a bank.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium">
            LoanCast changes that. Every loan is public. Every repayment builds reputation. 
            Every default has social consequences. Your cast becomes your credit history.

            Today, LoanCast serves the Farcaster community‚Äîdevelopers needing conference tickets, 
            creators buying equipment, friends helping friends through temporary crunches.

            Tomorrow, we believe social lending will be as common as social media. 
            Every community will have its own credit network. Every online reputation will have financial value. 
            Every person will have access to fair credit based on their social capital, not their paper wealth.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The first peer-to-peer lending platforms failed because they tried to be banks without being banks. 
            We're not trying to be a bank. We're building something new: a protocol where your word is your bond, 
            your network is your net worth, and your cast is your credit.
