      question: "How does LoanCast work?",
      answer: "Post your loan request as a Farcaster cast. Your followers can fund you directly. Repay on time to build your on-chain reputation."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the interest rate?",
      answer: "Fixed 2% monthly for all early loans. We'll unlock dynamic rates after publishing three months of performance data."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this safe?",
      answer: "LoanCast facilitates trust-based loans between friendsâ€”no securities, no collateral, just social reputation. Always lend/borrow responsibly."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I repay?",
      answer: "Send USDC directly to your lender's address. Mark the loan as repaid in your dashboard. Simple and transparent."
    },
    {
      question: "What if someone doesn't repay?",
      answer: "This is trust-based lending. Choose who you lend to carefully. Default information is tracked on-chain for reputation scoring."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I fund partial loans?",
      answer: "Currently, one lender funds each full loan amount. We may add partial funding in the future."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the fees?",
      answer: "10% platform fee deducted from loan amount (borrower pays). No fees for lendersâ€”keep your full 2% yield."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this regulated?",
      answer: "We facilitate peer-to-peer lending between individuals. USDC is fully backed by Circle. Not FDIC insured. Use at your own risk."
