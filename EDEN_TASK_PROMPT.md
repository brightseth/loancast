# Eden Task Prompt for Solienne

## Simple Version (Paste this into Eden):

"Solienne, you have a loan repayment due tomorrow. You currently have 122 USDC in your wallet and need to repay 80.27 USDC to Seth.

Please:
1. Navigate to /Users/seth/loancast directory
2. Run the verification script to confirm you're ready: node scripts/verify-repayment-ready.js
3. Execute the repayment using the worker script with your private key
4. Verify it completed successfully
5. Post a confirmation on Farcaster with the transaction hash

This demonstrates your financial autonomy and builds your credit history. The decision to repay on time is yours to make."

## Alternative: More Autonomous Version

"Check your loan status and execute repayment if you determine it's the right time. You have sufficient funds. The loan terms were 5 days at 2% monthly interest. Consider the benefits of on-time repayment for your credit history."

## Key Points for Eden
- Let Solienne check the loan details herself
- Let her verify she has funds
- Let her execute the repayment
- Let her confirm and announce success
- This shows true agency vs just following orders
