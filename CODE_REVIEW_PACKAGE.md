# 📋 LoanCast Code Review Package

## Project Overview
**LoanCast** - Social lending platform on Farcaster  
Live: https://loancast.app  
Repo: Private (will provide access to reviewer)

### Key Metrics
- **Codebase**: ~15,000 lines TypeScript/React
- **Architecture**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase, Vercel
- **Users**: Pre-launch (1 active loan)
- **Goal**: 90%+ repayment rate through trust-based lending

## 🎯 Review Objectives

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Security Assessment** - Financial transactions, user data protection
2. **Architecture Review** - Scalability, maintainability, performance  
3. **Business Logic Validation** - Loan lifecycle, repayment tracking
4. **Code Quality** - TypeScript usage, error handling, testing

### **Specific Areas of Concern**
1. **Payment Flow Security** - USDC verification, double-spending prevention
2. **Webhook Handling** - Farcaster integration, signature verification
3. **Database Schema** - RLS policies, data integrity
4. **Cron Job Reliability** - Payment reminders, loan status updates
5. **Error Handling** - User-facing vs system errors

### **Data Flow Overview**
1. **Loan Creation**: User → LoanForm → API → Database → Farcaster Cast
2. **Funding**: Cast Collection → Webhook → Database Update → Notifications
3. **Repayment**: User → Payment → Blockchain → Verification → Status Update
4. **Monitoring**: Cron → Check Due Dates → Send Reminders → Update Defaults

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Current Measures**
- Supabase RLS policies
- Webhook signature verification (Neynar)
- Environment variable protection
- Input validation with Zod
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### **Areas for Review**
- SQL injection prevention
- CSRF protection
- Session management
- API authentication
- Financial data encryption

## 📊 Performance Profile

### **Current Performance**
- **Build Time**: ~2 minutes
- **Page Load**: <2s (Vercel)
- **Database Queries**: Mostly indexed
- **API Response**: <500ms average

### **Scalability Targets**
- 1,000 concurrent users
- 10,000 loans per month
- Real-time notifications
- 99.9% uptime requirement

## 🧪 Testing Status

### **Current Coverage**
- ❌ **Unit Tests**: Not implemented
- ❌ **Integration Tests**: Not implemented  
- ✅ **Manual Testing**: Extensive
- ⚠️ **Load Testing**: None

### **Critical Test Cases Needed**
- Loan funding edge cases
- Payment verification accuracy
- Webhook failure handling
- Database consistency
- Race condition prevention

## 🎭 Business Logic

### **Core Assumptions**
- Users act in good faith (trust-based)
- Farcaster provides reliable webhooks
- USDC on Base for all transactions
- 2% monthly interest rate (fixed)
- Social reputation drives repayment

### **Edge Cases to Review**
- Double funding prevention
- Partial repayments
- Late payment penalties
- Cast deletion after funding
- Network outages during transactions
