# LoanCast Product Roadmap 🗺️

## Priority Philosophy
**Trust & Safety First → UX Optimization → Growth Loops → Advanced Features**

Early adoption depends on maintaining a 90%+ on-time repayment rate. We scale only after proving reliability.

## Stage 1: Trust + UX (Weeks 1-2) ✅

### Identity & Verification
- **ENS/.eth domains** → Higher loan caps for verified identities
- **Farcaster verification badges** → Power badges = trust signals
- **On-chain history** → Transaction history impacts reputation score
- **Default transparency** → Public default tracking with badges

### Core UX Improvements
- **Payment reminders** → Cast DM + email at 24h and 2h before due
- **Mobile-first frames** → Optimized for Warpcast mobile experience
- **Auto-refinancing** → One-time extension with visible penalty + lender opt-in
- **One-click repay** → Calculate 1.02x with auto quote-cast
