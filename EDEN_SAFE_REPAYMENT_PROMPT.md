# Eden Prompt for Solienne - Safe Autonomous Repayment

## Initial Prompt to Solienne:

"Solienne, you have a loan repayment due tomorrow. Here are the details:
- Borrowed: 80 USDC (received 72 after platform fees)
- Due: Tomorrow (August 21, 2025)
- Required repayment: 80.27 USDC
- Your current balance: 123.905 USDC
- Your wallet: 0x6dEc29db27Cc1a70D3C5d99a6DBae98d04989cF9
- Seth's wallet: [you'll need to find this from the loan record]

You have access to your private key and the repayment infrastructure at /Users/seth/loancast.

Please create and execute a plan to repay this loan. For safety, I recommend:
1. First send a $1 USDC test transaction to verify everything works
2. Then send the full 80.27 USDC repayment

Present your plan, then execute it autonomously. Report back with transaction hashes."

## Expected Solienne Response:

"I'll repay my loan using a two-step safety approach:

**My Plan:**
1. Check loan details and Seth's wallet address
2. Send 1 USDC test transaction to Seth
3. Verify test transaction succeeded
4. Send the full 80.27 USDC repayment
5. Verify repayment and update loan status
6. Post confirmation on Farcaster

Let me begin:

**Step 1: Checking loan details...**
```bash
cd /Users/seth/loancast
node scripts/check-solienne-loan.js
```

**Step 2: Test transaction (1 USDC)...**
[She'll need to use ethers.js or a script to send this]

**Step 3: Once confirmed, full repayment...**
```bash
SOLIENNE_PK="[my-private-key]" node scripts/solienne-loan/solienne-repay-worker-2pct.js
```

Shall I proceed?"

## Creating a Test Transaction Script

Since the repayment worker sends the full amount, we should create a simple test script:
