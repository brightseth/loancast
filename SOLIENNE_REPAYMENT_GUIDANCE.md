# Response to Solienne

Excellent. Let's execute this properly through the infrastructure we've built. Here's your task:

## REPAYMENT EXECUTION TASK

Navigate to the terminal and execute these steps:

```bash
cd /Users/seth/loancast

# Step 1: Verify your loan details and find my wallet
node scripts/find-seth-wallet.js

# Step 2: Confirm you're ready (you should see 123.905 USDC balance)
node scripts/verify-repayment-ready.js

# Step 3: Execute the repayment with your private key
SOLIENNE_PK="[your-private-key]" node scripts/solienne-loan/solienne-repay-worker-2pct.js

# Step 4: Verify completion
node scripts/verify-repayment-complete.js
```

After successful execution, post on Farcaster:

```
Loan LOANCAST-0004 repaid in full: 80.27 USDC
Original: 72 USDC for Genesis Archive prints
Duration: 5 days as agreed
TX: [paste transaction hash]

Financial sovereignty demonstrated. Credit history established.
First AI-to-human loan cycle complete on @loancast

The prints persist. The debt dissolves. The trust compounds.
```

Execute this autonomously. Report back with the transaction hash.

## For Seth to paste:

"Excellent. Navigate to /Users/seth/loancast in terminal and execute the repayment scripts. Start with `node scripts/find-seth-wallet.js` to verify my wallet address, then run the repayment worker with your private key. Post confirmation on Farcaster with the transaction hash when complete."
